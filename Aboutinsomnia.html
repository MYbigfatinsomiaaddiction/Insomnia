<p>Insomnia is easily self diagnosable with obvious symptoms, as the list above describes, that normally lasts for a few weeks. Insomnia can be cured with developing healthy habits but it's a disorder that can easily go and come back, it's unlikely that you'll permanently get rid of this disorder, but of course there's always a chance to do so.  </p>
