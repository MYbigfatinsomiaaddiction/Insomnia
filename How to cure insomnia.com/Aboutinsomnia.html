<div class="about">
  <p>Insomnia is a very common sleep disorder. 
     having insomnia means that you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.
Most likely, insomnia will come from bad sleep habits, depression, anxiety, 
lack of exercise, chronic illnesses, or certain drugs. </p></div>

<p>Insomnia is easily self diagnosable with obvious symptoms, 
    as the list above describes, that normally lasts for a few weeks.
    Insomnia can be cured with developing healthy habits but it's a disorder that can easily go and come back,
    so it's not the type of disorder that you can permanently get rid of this disorder, but of course there's always a chance to do so. </p>
